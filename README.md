# vmsg (alpha)

So I found out there's no adequate VK instant messaging client for Linux and decided to build my own.

This app is written using ReactJS and Electron.

# requirements

- node
- npm

# stack

- ReactJS
- Electron
- Browserify
- Babel (ES6)
- Gulp

# install & run

**Note**: `npm install` will take a while because it's gonna download ~200 MB of node-ish stuff (sigh.)

    $ npm install
    $ npm run build
    $ npm start

# state

This app is being actively developed by me.
Help and contribution are appreciated.

:)
