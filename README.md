# vmsg (alpha)

So I found out there's no adequate VK instant messaging client for Linux and decided to build my own.

This app is written using ReactJS and Electron.

# requirements

- node
- npm

# install & run

    $ npm install
    $ gulp build
    $ npm start

# state

This app is being actively developed by me.
Help and contribution are appreciated.

:)
